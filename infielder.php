				<h2 id="player_summary">2015 Summary</h2>

				<p>
					Sam Travis is well-known first baseman prospect playing currently for the Portland Sea Dogs. The main
					asset he provides to the game of baseball would have to be his contact hitting. Travis has a compact swing
					that lacks loft thus ensuring many of the balls he hits do not leave the ballpark and do not pop out, because
					of this swing he has found to be one of the most toughest outs in all of Minor League Baseball consistently
					hitting .300. While Travis does have a weakness for trying to catch up to inside fastballs, he has shown great
					plate discipline that is coveted in the Major League. Travis is also a very competent fielder as he has soft hands
					and is very capable of fielding balls out of the dirt. Sam Travis figures to be a productive professional baseball
					player, and projects to be much similar to Billy Butler with fielding ability.

				<h2 id="player_summary">2015 Summary</h2>

				<p>
					Very few prospects warrant the attention that Yoan Moncada has received. Moncada is a five-tool prospect from
					Cuba, The Red Sox have committed 63 million dollars to feature him within their organization. While that is
					absolutely a staggering amount of money for a baseball player much less an unproven prospect, but Moncada appears
					to be the real deal with no glaring weaknesses within his overall game. Moncada can hit from both sides of the plate
					with potential to be a quality contact and power-hitter. He can field Second and Third base with the arm to fit the
					position. But maybe his best quality is his athletic ability; Moncada stands out on the field as he looks like
					a football player. His size and speed are a rarity in Major League Baseball. Moncada projects to be a switch hitting
					Robinson Cano with incredible baserunning ability. If that isn't a top prospect in the Majors than I don't know what
					is.

				</div>

				<h2 id="player_summary">2015 Summary</h2>

				<p>
					While it is now difficult to consider Xander Bogaerts a prospect in the Major League nowadays due to him already
					being a success, the Aruban success-story is only 23 years of age. Xander managed to hit an incredible .320 batting
					average in his second full season with the Red Sox. He also managed to improve his fielding drastically from the often
					difficult shortstop position. Xander has shown above average size and athleticism that has people questioning what is
					in store for Xander's future? Where Xander seeks and projects to improve in career would have to be his power-hitting
					abilities while 81 RBI's last season he only managed to hit 7 homeruns a number that is shockingly low for a productive
					number 3 hitter. Another place Xander could improve would be his plate discipline, while hitting .320 in 156 games last
					season he only had 32 walks making getting on base for Xander a little more difficult. Improving those aspects of Bogaerts
					game would surely make him the best shortstop in all of Baseball.

					<h2 id="player_title">Rafael Devers</h2>
				</div>

				<h2 id="player_summary">2015 Summary</h2>

				<p>
					Rafael Devers is an intriguing 19 year-old third baseman prospect from the Dominican Republic. I believe he is an interesting
					prospect because what he brings to the table is something the Red Sox is currently lacking; power. Rafael projects to hit over
					30 homeruns at the young age of 19. Where Devers needs to focus his endeavours is building himself athletically so he can get
					around easier and becoming a more quality reliable fielder. At Devers' current build he is a bit more suited to become a first
					baseman than a third baseman, which is good and fine but a growing trend within the construct of the major league is their ability
					to field multiple positions. Rafael being able to offer those two roles on the squad would be beneficial for the Red Sox. Rafael
					figures to be a player similar to Mike Moustakas with a higher ceiling for hitting with power.
